# ColorSearch
A Chrome extension created so when you search a color code, it shows up as a search card

##Setup
Either download the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-search/eogeejfgkddjjibpecmcgdohpknkjabo), or you can use it in another browser as an injection script.
It only needs to be injected to Google.com

##Usage
Just search the color you want, wheter it be HTML, RGB, or Hex. If it's a valid CSS color, the card will show up
